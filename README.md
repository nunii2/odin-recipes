# odin-recipes

This is my first website I will create using only HTML.
The website will contain a few of my favourite recipes I have tried in the past month. It will contain an index page as well as links to the recipes. 
The objectives I will attempt to reach is to use ordered and unordered lists, insert an image, use absolute and relative links and more that I currently cannot remember but will add them as I finish the project and return back here.

Nice coding!
